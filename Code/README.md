Requirements:
=============

The Python programs included in this package were written and
tested using Python 3.10.0 running on windows

The following extra packages are required:
- numpy
- bitarray:  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bitarray

Running the attack program:
===========================

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. click strat in Guide page
2. Import database using topright button
3. click Encoding in the left bar
4. choosing Bloom Filter encoding method 
5. choosing encode dataset and plain text dataset, then select attributes for encoding
6. fill the encoding parameter setting (you can see information for each parameter, or see details in Guide page)
7. click Encode in middle-right and then check encoding result
8. choosing Pattern-mining based attack or Bit pattern frequency as your wish
9. fill the attack parameter setting (you can see information in this page)
10.click attack button. (process bar could help you check the time)
11.finish attack and check the attack result in evaluation page. (Or attack failed and check the error log in evaluation page)
